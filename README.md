# Game Of Life

I have followed a tutorial which shows how to create Conway's Game of Life using React.

Rules

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Getting started
** requirements to run - node, npm **
* git clone https://github.com/Leigan0/GameOfLifeReact.git
* npm install
* npm start
* navigate to http://localhost:3000/

## What it looks like

## Next steps

* My next aim is to refactor the code
* To rewrite with TDD approach
